## **ðŸŒ¾ CropSense â€“ Smart Crop Prediction**

CropSense is a machine learning-based crop prediction system designed to recommend the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental parameters. The system currently supports 22 crop classes and uses multiple machine learning models for prediction.

## **ðŸ“Š Model Performance**
The model was trained using a dataset of soil and environmental parameters. The Random Forest Classifier gave the best results, but we also experimented with other models such as Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes.

### **Random Forest Metrics**:
### **Accuracy: 0.9919**

### **F1 Score: 0.9907**

### **Precision: 0.9921**

### **Recall: 0.9903**


Other models like Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes performed reasonably but with slightly lower accuracy. Random Forest is currently recommended for deployment.

## **ðŸ§° Hardware & IoT Integration**

This system can be integrated with IoT devices to perform  **real-time crop recommendations**. The following sensors and devices are suggested:
