## **üåæ CropSense ‚Äì Smart Crop Prediction**

CropSense is a machine learning-based crop prediction system designed to recommend the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental parameters. The system currently supports 22 crop classes and uses multiple machine learning models for prediction.

## **üìä Model Performance**
The model was trained using a dataset of soil and environmental parameters. The Random Forest Classifier gave the best results, but we also experimented with other models such as Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes.

### **Random Forest Metrics**:
### **Accuracy: 0.9919**

### **F1 Score: 0.9907**

### **Precision: 0.9921**

### **Recall: 0.9903**

Other models like Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes performed reasonably but with slightly lower accuracy. Random Forest is currently recommended for deployment.

The following **Multiclass ROC Curve (One-vs-Rest)** shows the performance of our Random Forest model across all 22 crop classes. Each class achieves an AUC of 1.00, indicating **perfect separability**:

## **üéØ Purpose**

The main purpose of CropSense is to:

Help farmers select the optimal crop based on soil nutrients and environmental factors.

Integrate with IoT sensors for real-time monitoring and recommendations.

Serve as a scalable platform for precision agriculture and data-driven farming.

Provide a user-friendly interface for farmers and researchers to make informed crop decisions.
